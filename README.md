This code is a simple password strength checker. Let me break it down for you:

The code imports the re module, which is used for regular expressions, a powerful tool for searching and manipulating strings.
Then, it defines several functions:

check_digit(pwd: str) -> bool: This function checks if the password contains at least one digit (0-9).

check_uppercase(pwd: str) -> bool: This function checks if the password contains at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).

check_lowercase(pwd: str) -> bool: This function checks if the password contains at least one lowercase letter (a-z).

check_special_char(pwd: str) -> bool: This function checks if the password contains at least one special character (~!@#$%^&*?).

check_white_space(pwd: str) -> bool: This function checks if the password contains any whitespace characters.

check_length(pwd: str) -> bool: This function checks if the length of the password is between 6 and 12 characters.

Next, the code prompts the user to input a password.
It then checks the password against all the conditions defined in the functions using the all() function. If all conditions are met, it prints a message saying the password is strong. Otherwise, it prints a message listing the requirements the password doesn't meet.

If any condition is not met, it prints out specific requirements the password must meet:
At least one digit.
At least one uppercase letter.
At least one lowercase letter.
At least one special character.
No whitespace characters.
Length between 6 and 12 characters.

That's it! This code helps users understand the strength of their passwords and what requirements they need to meet for a stronger one.
